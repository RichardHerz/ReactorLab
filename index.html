    The Reactor Lab is a collection of interactive simulations of chemical reactors for
    active learning.
    </p>
    <p>
    The purpose of this site is to host the Master repository of the open-source Reactor Lab project.
    When files in the Master repository are updated, the updated files are pulled
    by a desktop Reactor Lab distribution to update its files when it is put "on line."
    Currently, this applies only to desktop distributions obtained from this GitHub project.
