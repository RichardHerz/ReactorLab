# ReactorLab
The Reactor Lab is a collection of interactive simulations of chemical reactors for active learning.

This project is being built with the open-source, Community Edition of LiveCode. Get it at www.LiveCode.org.

You need to use the LiveCode IDE, version 8 or higher, in order to use this project.

If you are interested, please read the Wiki for this project and contact Richard Herz.

The Lab has been developed by Richard K. Herz and used by his students of Chemical Reaction Engineering since 1993. The Lab was initially developed with HyperCard, and then migrated to MetaCard, Revolution, and now LiveCode. Some of the code dates from 1993. This code still works due to the intelligent design of Bill Atkinson and Dan Winkler, the inventors of HyperCard and HyperTalk, and later stewards of the language.

The most recent builds of application files for Windows OS can be downloaded from ReactorLab.net.
